<pmeta id="title">Merry Christmas</pmeta>

I had intended to have a paper writeup handy, but the preparations and celebrations of Christmas meant I was occupied.

Oh well, another year of unfinished [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) as well, this year I tried to work with [uiua](https://www.uiua.org/) an [apl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language))-like language, but I didn't really get enough done to say I really felt the APL enlightenment.

My stack of papers has grown mostly out of interest and following references from the [last paper on fp^2](/2023/1210-tmp-fipfp.html).

Merry Christmas (and I know it's not the 25th but Christmas is really more a season/state of mind)
