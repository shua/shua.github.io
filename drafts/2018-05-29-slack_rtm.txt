working on trying to use slack from commandline; not great because in order to get "client" scope permission, we need to use oauth 2.0
anyway, here's how I got "client" scope oauth permission for the entire app 
(later, may want to just give it limited permissions, and request client permissions on every login? meh)

1. go to app control panel ("Your Apps" -> <the app> -> "OAuth & Permissions")
2. right-click on "Reinstall App", and copy the link location
3. modify the `scope` url parameter to read `scope=client`
4. go to that url, and accept the change in permissions; now the access token will have client permissions

helper function for using slack api

	slackc() {
		method=$1
		api=$2
		shift 2
		curl -X $method -d "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $@ "https://slack.com/api/$api"
	}

also,

	npm install wsc
	alias wsc=<path to node_modules>/wsc/wsc

now, you can call

	TOKEN=<app token, starts with "xoxp-">
	slackc GET rtm.connect |jq . >rtm.connect.txt
	wsc $(<rtm.connect.txt jq .url |sed 's/^"//' |sed 's/"$//')

and you've got a slack rtm connection
I joined an im with myself using the webclient, and got a message in wsc

	< {"type":"im_open","user":"UXXXXXXXX","channel":"DXXXXXXXX","event_ts":"1527543437.000020"}

so I sent a message to myself in wsc

	> { "id": 1, "type": "message", "channel": "DXXXXXXXX", "text": "testing this websocket" }

and it showed up in the webclient
sick
