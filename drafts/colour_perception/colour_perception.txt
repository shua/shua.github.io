colour vs light
	colour is based on perceptors n-dimensions
	light is based on frequency+amplitude 2-dimensions

	not totally independent, light triggers all perceptors
	brain is pretty good at filtering and boosting

2D perceptor mapping
	can map a single frequency of light using 2 perceptors
	1. yellow := (1.0, 0.2)
	2. blue   := (0.2, 1.0)
	3. unk    := (0.6, 0.01)

	i.  |unk, A| > |A, B|    0.6 > 0.2
	ii. |unk, B| < |unk, A|  0.01 < 0.6

	by i we know know that light is not between A and B
	ii says light is closer to B than it is to A

	so map it back to colour, say A is "blue" and B is "yellow", on on our regular ROYGBIV

	   B A
	 ROYGBIV
	^^^^ light has to be somewhere over here

	since we have actual measurements, we could work with
	- red := (?, ?)
	- orange := (?, ?)

	and place it relative to those as well

2D perceptor mapping (additive)
	instead of a single pure light, we can add two colours together and see what we get

	vvv this doesn't seem right vvv
	yellow + yellow := (1.0, 0.4)
	yellow + blue   := (1.0, 1.0)

	so we can either shine a single green light, or a yellow light and a blue light, and the perceptors will have the same perception

	many things in nature emit or reflect many different wavelengths of light

3D perceptor mapping (additive)
	Humans generally have 3 perceptors
	1. red   := (1.0, 0.2, 0.1)
	2. green := (0.2, 1.0, 0.7)
	3. blue  := (0.1, 0.7, 1.0)

	this is a 3D space, which is even more than light exists in, so our perception of colour is even more dimensions than actually exist

	we use the trick of combining light to give the perception of colour in TV screens

	normal light between red and blue will activate our green perceptor
	4. unk1 := (0.4, 0.8, 0.5)

magenta is a "fake colour"
	but we can trick our brain into seeing some other, fully saturated colour, between red and blue using a combination
	5. 0.5 * red + 0.5 * blue :=  -- should be very red/blue, little green

	so that is a valid colour even if it can't be mapped back to a single wavelength of light, we call it something like magenta

	I've heard magenta called a "fake colour" and it's maybe too harsh.
	Magenta is a very real colour (for everyone with 3 perceptors), that cannot be produced by a single pure light

	can think of it as a topological problem, where you must travel from one perceptor to the other
		consider (0,1)x(0,1)x(0,1) with (1,1,1) and (0,0,0) removed
		pick two points
			make a path between them
			remove all interior points of that path
			repeat that as many times as you can, and that's how many "fake colours" you can get

	the way I chose it, the path (1,0,0),(1,1,0),(0,1,0),(0,1,1),(0,0,1) matches the path from red->blue that one would get using a single pure light
	since that light would have to move up frequencies, it would have to pass through green on the way

	however, we can remove all those points, and we still have (1,0,1), and the path (1,0,0),(1,0,1),(0,0,1)
	that is the path "through" magenta, which cannot be created using a single pure light

	now we've removed all points except (1,0,0), (0,0,1) which are not adjacent, so we have 2 paths
	since we have two paths that don't cross each other, we can travel both these directions and get a kind of cycle, that cycle is often displayed as the "colour wheel"

	The colour wheel is a wheel because we have 3 perceptors
	if we had 4 perceptors, we'd get into a (0,1)^4 space, which means we'd have 3 paths from any two points (w/o "white"/"black")
		(1,0,0,0),(1,1,0,0),(1,1,1,0),(0,1,1,0),(0,0,1,0)
		(1,0,0,0),(1,1,0,0),(0,1,0,0),(0,1,1,0),(0,0,1,0)
		                    ^^^^^^^^^ is (1,1,1,0) perceived as just *really* (0,1,0,0)?

	Mantis shrimp have 12 perceptors, how many "fake colours" could they perceive?  What would their "colour wheel" be?


perception is inf-dimensions
	shining multiple lights results in a single colour, but it's still physically n lights, they don't merge into a single wavelength light
	that means every new shined light adds a new dimension in possible perception of colour
	tempted to say colour blind people and dogs have a "truer" sense of light, but they have a "truer" sense of a single light
	for our physical world, we generally have more than a single light hitting our eyes, so 3 perceptors can tell more about 2> sources of light than 2 perceptors can
		what is it that 3 perceptors can tell that 2 don't?
	why do we see a continuum instead of perceiving 3 discrete values for everything?
	similar to our brain mapping binocular vision to a single continuous view of 3D space, but we cheat that with illusions of depth

	maybe most colours are "illusions", our brain thinks the light hitting us is pure, but really most light is combinations of multiple lights
