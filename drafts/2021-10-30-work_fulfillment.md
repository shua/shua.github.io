Having moved into a new job a few months ago, I was thinking again of why someone leaves a job.
The obvious reasons are that the job is abusive, or the pay is not high enough to live off of.
But if you don't *need* to leave a job, why do people do it anyway?

I think the specifics of any person leaving are not too hard to understand, but I started classifying the specifics into three categories under the grand scheme of "feeling fulfilled":
1. working on something that interests you
2. doing work that is appreciated by others
3. fulfilling someone else's needs for life

I would say most, if not every job has some combination of these three, but some jobs lean heavier into one or the other.
For instance, I imagine most people are drawn to being an academic or an artist for mostly the first category: interest.
While it is nice to find ways that your research or art are appreciated by others, and someone may have a need that you help with (eg research into medical devices), but it feels to me that someone going into either of these fields should really be working on something that interests them, or they are likely to leave.
To take examples from culture and the stories we share, there exists a trope of some character realizing that they aren't following their dreams and that they work in some "soulless" office building and one of the steps to improvement is quitting the office and moving to something they're passionate about.
I would often joke that you can tell these stories were written by writers: the unstated assumption is that no one is happy in these jobs, but on the contrary I've met many people that live in "soulless office buildings", and I myself have enjoyed working in a cubicle.

An example of jobs that are more heavily dependent on the third category may be doctor, teacher, lawyer and perhaps soldier.
For a doctor, you might often be faced with decisions that directly decide whether someone lives or dies, or what quality of life they might have.
For a teacher, I hear too often teachers that would like to look for better jobs "but those kids need me".
Again, while it is nice to be interested in the work that you do, I wouldn't say of the teachers or doctors I know that the field is their *passion*.
Many people fulfill this desire by having kids or volunteering their time to some humanitarian charity.
My dad had a joke that most people searching for purpose in their life should have kids: making sure they don't die, get maimed, or grow into psychopaths is enough responsibility and purpose for anyone.

The second category is the last one I'm covering, and I think it's easier to give counter examples than examples.
I decided *not* to go into academia after my undergraduate degree, because I felt like the research I had done and published, while interesting to me to work on, was not used or appreciated by anyone.
I wanted a job where people told me what they wanted, I built it for them, and they were happy with the results.
I knew that the work I would do starting out in my field would not be very interesting to me, but I felt so unfulfilled in my taste of academic life, that I was willing to give it a shot.
I didn't have any desire to work a job that fulfilled someone else's needs, in fact it was difficult for me to even see all the good I could do in such a job because all my brain thinks about is how many people I could kill or maim. No thank you.
Instead I can push the wrong code or press the wrong button, and the worst that happens is people lose money (which, yes, may indirectly lead to losing a life), but that is way different from losing a life.

Like I said before, I think all jobs have bits of all three categories.
I believe also that different people may have different needs: I applaud the hollywood writer that left a soulless cubicle job to pursue writing, but there's no need to point fingers and call those left behind sheep or fools.
Last, this model may be incomplete, but it has helped me clarify why exactly I feel unfulfilled in a job, and steps I can take short of quitting and looking for the "perfect" job.
I focused on hobbies and finding MOOCs I was interested in to satisfy my craving for the first category.
Similarly, volunteering or giving to charities helps fulfill the third.
So I can be comfortable enough in my job that doesn't fulfill the first and third, because it does fulfill the second, and that is what I needed more of.

At least for now,
