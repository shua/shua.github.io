calculus (language) with pure functional semantics, but requires no de/allocation

INTRO
motivating example:
    reverse(xs: list a) -> list a 
      reverse-acc(xs, Nil)
    reverse-acc(xs: list a, acc: list a) -> list a
      match xs
        Cons(x, xx) -> reverse-acc(xx, Cons(x, acc))
        Nil         -> acc

nice theoretical properties, but de/allocs Cons on each step
compared to imperative
    reverse(xs: *list a) -> *list a
      let next = xs->next;
      let acc = xs;
      let tmp = nil;
      acc->next = nil;
      while next != nil
        tmp = next->next;
        next->next = acc;
        acc = next;
        next = tmp;
constant memory needed, but much harder to do proofs on (separation logic eww)

but, if own+unique params, can merge matched Cons with constructed Cons and reuse
never (de)allocate memory, or use unbounded stack space, executed fully in-place
non-toy example is "splay trees": self-balancing trees, every access restructures tree so elem is "splayed" to top
  eg lookup returns elem and new tree
generally not good for fn langs, because restructuring means destructing and constructing new tree

zippers and unbox'd tuples
define splay tree with ints as `stree` and fn'l alt to imp "parent ptrs" `szipper`
eg fn to focus left, `fip` limits syntax, `match!` indicates destruct

    type stree
      Node(left: stree, value: int, right: stree)
      Leaf
    type szipper
      Root
      NodeL(up: szipper, value: int, right: stree)
      NodeR(left: stree, value: int, up: szipper)

    fip fun left(t: stree, ctx: szipper): stree, szipper
      match! t
        Node(l, x, r) -> (l, NodeL(ctx, x, r))
        Leaf          -> (Leaf, ctx)

`match! t (Node(l,x,r))` rms `t` and adds `l,x,r` and reuse credit `<>3`
unable to split reuse credit, also linear ie must use once
2nd-class tuples require no credits (only used for return vals, and immediately destructed)

    fip fun lookup(t: stree, x: int): (bool, stree)
      zlookup(t,x,Root)
    fip fun zlookup(t: stree, x: int, ctx: szipper): (bool, stree)
      match! t
        Leaf -> (False, splay-leaf(ctx))  // not found, splay anyway
        Node(l,y,r) ->
          if   x<y then zlookup(l,x,NodeL(ctx,y,r))  // go left
          elif x>y then zlookup(r,x,NodeR(l,y,ctx))  // go right
          else (True, splay(Top(l,y,r),ctx))         // found, splay
    type top
      Top(left: stree, value: int, right: stree)

assumed cons with no fields (eg Root) requires no alloc (bc rep'd as tagged ptr)
paper calls 0-ary cons "atoms"
define `Top` to pass reuse credits, without `splay(l: stree, v: int, r: stree, ctx: szipper)` cannot construct `Node(_,_,_)` result from destructed `ctx: Root` (can't make <>3 from <>0)
? why required named types instead of boxed tuple? I guess if `f((x,y), z)` could be `fip` but `f(x, y, z)` couldn't that would be weird

    fip fun splay(top: top, ctx: szipper): stree
      match! top
        Top(l,x,r) -> match! ctx
          Root                       -> Node(l,x,r)
          NodeL(Root,y,ry)           -> Node(l,x,Node(r,y,ry))
          NodeL(NodeR(lz,z,up),y,ry) -> splay(Top(Node(lz,z,l),x,Node(r,y,ry)), up)
          NodeL(NodeL(up,z,rz),y,ry) -> splay(Top(l,x,Node(r,y,Node(ry,z,rz))), up)
          NodeR(ly,y,Root)           -> Node(Node(ly,y,l),x,r)
          NodeR(ly,y,NodeL(up,z,rz)) -> splay(Top(Node(ly,y,l),x,Node(r,z,rz)), up)
          NodeR(ly,y,NodeR(lz,z,up)) -> splay(Top(Node(Node(lz,z,ly),y,l),x,r), up)

    fip fun splay-leaf(ctx: szipper): stree
      match! ctx
        Root          -> Leaf
        NodeL(up,x,r) -> splay(Top(Lead,x,r),up)
        NodeR(l,x,up) -> splay(Top(l,x,Leaf),up)

allow for higher-order via 2nd-class 'borrow'd params (from counting imm beans!)
also fn application inside fbip/fip cannot modify any captured free var in-place
therefore only "top-level" (static?) fns are passed, not arbitrary closures
also allow "fn but in-place" (fbip) which allows stack (and dealloc), as well as fip(n)/fbip(n) which implies "might need to alloc n constructors"

    fbip fun smap(t: stree, ^f: int->int): stree
      match! t
        Node(l,v,r) -> Node(smap(f,l), f(v), smap(f,r)) // uses f twice!
        Leaf        -> Leaf

annoyance of linear types is can force 2 versions of fn, one destructing and taking owned unique refs, one borrowing and allocating
Koka uses "Perceus precise ref counting", dynamic refcount
allows 1 def, and compiler inserts runtime checks for destructing/allocating based on whether ref is owned

    fip fun reverse-acc(xs: list a, acc: list a): list a
      match! xs
        Cons(x, xx) ->
          val ru = if is-unique(xs) then &xs else { dup(x); dup(xx); decref(xs); alloc(2) }
          reverse-acc(xx, Cons@ru(x,acc))
        Nil -> acc

; `Cons@ru` similar to imm beans' `with [] cons_2...`
reuse credit <>2 is compiled into named tok ru
lose static guarantee that owned params are uinque
; doesn't this break fip? because there's an alloc(2) right there? maybe fip(2)?
> when we call a function like map fully in-place, it means that the function itself does not intrinsically allocate any memory. However, any particular evaluation can still allocate by passing in a non-fip function, for example `map(xs, fn(x) Cons(x, Nil))`. That is an essential part of our approach though, where we are able to reason about a fully in-place function like `map` in isolation but still allow it to be used in allocating scenarios from a non-FIP context.

Contributions
- novel fully in-place (FIP) calculus, def fns exec'd fully in-place
  standard fn opsem for lang, and sem in terms of fixed store (no de/allocs)
  show that atoms, unboxed tuples necessary for many common scenarios
- describe some interesting algs, defun'd CPS transforms; red-black insert, cons/append on finger trees, merge sort qsort
- dyn embedding of FIP, lambda-fip. FIP is exactly subset of lambda-fip w/o need for dyn refcounts, FIP can interact with other non-fip, copying when necessary
