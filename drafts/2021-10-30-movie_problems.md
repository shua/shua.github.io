I like to think of movie problems as falling into two categories:
1. Problems of choosing
2. Problems of doing

Most dramas fall into the first: main character is having trouble making a decision, it's not that hard to do the thing, they just need to figure out what it is they should do.
For instance, most action movies and a lot of horror movies fall into the second: main character *knows* who the villain is, they know what must be done, but the question is whether they are strong/smart/fast/etc enough to do it.

I have been told by friends that they don't like action movies because they're "dumb" or "uninteresting", but that dramas are better because they're more intelligent.
It feels kind of like listening to someone complain about watching grappling sports like MMA or college wrestling.
When they don't understand what's going on, it seems like a dumb sport, it's just two people sweating all over each other while hugging real hard; everyone that enjoys the sport is a simpleton, and there are far better things to be done with one's time.
Watching the sport with someone who has actually competed in it is a very different experience, and I have gotten the feeling that I'm watching strategy unfold that rivals chess.

The Soloist was an enjoyable movie about a virtuoso violin player that was homeless, and a newspaper reporter learning about him.
The reporter struggles with the question of whether he should push the player to adapt to "normal" society, move into a house, or allow him to continue living his hard, but chosen, life on the streets.
It is not that difficult to help someone move into a house.
There are no action movies where the main character starts out so weak they can't move into their house, and then throughout the movie gains the strength and tools necessary to move into the house.
As an action movie, The Soloist is very uninteresting.
As a drama, The Soloist is great.
It is fairly uncreative, which is not necessarily a mark against the movie.
Many reasons why we love and identify with stories is *because* they are familiar, so The Soloist centers on a problem of choosing that many who live in cities can easily relate to.

Die Hard is an enjoyable movie about a cop that fights basically solo against a group of heavily armed terrorists holding hostages in an office building.
It is not that difficult to tell who the bad guy is, and the main character doesn't spend a lot of time mulling over his decisions.
Instead, it is a fantastical story about a single "good guy" that manages to fight through impossible odds and situations to finally save all the hostages and stop all the bad guys from putting anyone else in danger.
It is pretty difficult to stage a drama in such conditions, because the audience would then be asked to both focus on what difficult choices the character must make as well as how difficult it is to do anything.
A Die Hard where the enemy is the main character's homophobic father, and the main character has to struggle with whether he should come out to his dad on the chance that he may be accepted, all while swinging from rooftops by a firehouse and running across glass, is an interesting plot no doubt, but risks alienating both drama and action enthusiasts.
As a drama, Die Hard is pretty uninteresting.
As action, Die Hard is great.
It is a very creative movie, choosing to turn against the more traditional "trained killer" as the main good guy, instead opting for a sarcastic, balding, but still strong cop from new jersey.
The problem in this movie is *not* a familiar one to most people, but we can still enjoy seeing someone fight through impossible odds and win, and there's a good reason why so many stories follow that pattern.
